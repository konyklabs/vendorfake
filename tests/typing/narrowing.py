"""The narrowing, asserted statically. Nothing here runs.

FOR: proving that ``unit("clover")`` gives a type checker a ``CloverSeed`` and
not a union, which is a claim only a type checker can settle. ``mypy`` is
pointed at this directory by ``pyproject.toml``; ``assert_type`` fails the run
if an inferred type drifts, so a regression in the overloads shows up as a red
type-check rather than as a consumer's ``isinstance`` coming back.

Not collected by pytest -- the file is not named ``test_*`` and this directory
is not a package -- because there is nothing here to execute. The negatives are
here too, as ``# type: ignore[<code>]`` lines: ``warn_unused_ignores`` under
``--strict`` turns each one red the day the error it expects stops occurring.

``served`` is checked alongside ``unit`` because it carries the same overloads
for the same reason, and an overload set that is never exercised rots.
