"""One mutant per contract branch, each broken in exactly one way, and the check it must trip.

FOR: proving the conformance suite discriminates. Every contract in
``conformance/manifest.json`` is answered here by at least one unit that
violates it, and the meta-tests in ``tests/conformance/test_mutants.py`` assert
both directions -- the named check goes red, and no unnamed check does.

READING THIS FILE. Each mutant states the defect, its provenance, and the
check ids it must turn red. Two of them are not inventions:

* :data:`PERMISSIVE_SELF_TRANSITION` is the TypeScript reference's
  ``canTransition`` short-circuit, which makes a second payment on a COMPLETED
  order succeed.
* :data:`UNGATED_IN_BAND_CHAOS` is the losing bake-off entry's unconditional
  per-request chaos merge, which injected faults on a unit with fault
  injection switched off, for any caller who knew the field name.

Everything else is labelled ``hypothetical`` and means it: a defect nobody has
shipped in this lineage, written to give a contract something to catch.

M22 through M30 were written against measured holes rather than imagined ones.
Each reproduces a mutation that was applied to this codebase and left the whole
suite green: authentication deleted, a capability gate skipped for one
operation, the journal recording the version it read, the webhooks gate removed
outright, a retry schedule declared and not followed, idempotent replay
disabled, a cursor's query fingerprint ignored, a seed drawn from the process
id, and a vendor whose unit will not start at all.

WHAT IS NOT REACHABLE FROM A PRODUCTION PATH. Nothing in this module is
imported by ``src/vendorfake/``. Every mutation is applied by handing a
deliberately wrong collaborator to a constructor that already takes one, so
the seams are real and the defects are not.
