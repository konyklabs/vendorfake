"""What a mutant is, and how one is turned into a conformance target.

FOR: making "this suite can fail" a checkable statement. A conformance suite
that has only ever been run against a correct unit has demonstrated that it
terminates, not that it discriminates. A mutant is a unit broken in exactly
one way, shipped with the check ids it must turn red -- so the suite is tested
the way any other predicate is tested: with inputs on both sides of it.

INVARIANT: **a mutant declares its collateral.** Trips are what must go red;
:attr:`Mutant.also_trips` is what is *allowed* to go red as well, and it comes
with a written reason. Anything else going red fails the meta-test. Without
that rule a mutant that broke the unit outright would "catch" every check and
prove nothing about the one it names -- which is the failure mode the whole
exercise is guarding against, so it is not left to judgement.

SECOND INVARIANT: **the null mutant exists.** :data:`NULL_MUTANT` mutates
nothing and must be entirely green. It is what makes a red check under any
other mutant attributable to that mutant rather than to this harness -- which
builds its units a little differently from ``registry.create_unit`` in order to
reach the control-plane and selector seams, and would otherwise be an
unexamined variable sitting under every result.
