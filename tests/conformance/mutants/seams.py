"""The three seams a mutant may enter through, and nothing else.

FOR: breaking exactly one contract at a time, through wiring that a *real*
defect could travel through, so that a red check is evidence about the
production seam rather than about a patched module.

INVARIANT: **no mutant uses ``monkeypatch``.** Every mutation below is a
substitution the production composition root already accepts:

``VendorOverlay``
    A :class:`~vendorfake.core.kernel.types.VendorDefinition` that delegates
    every member to a real vendor and overrides the ones a mutant names. This
    is the seam a *vendor author* makes mistakes in, and it is the one the
    fork contract is written against.

``replace_control_route``
    The control plane is handed to :class:`~vendorfake.core.kernel.unit.Unit`
    as a factory (``control_routes=``), and a :class:`Route` is a frozen
    dataclass whose ``handler`` is data. Replacing one handler is therefore a
    construction-time substitution, not a patch. It is the only seam that can
    express a defect in something a check observes *solely* through the control
    plane -- the transition predicate, the journal, the echo route -- because
    the whole design point of this suite is that a check never reaches past it.

``ClientOverlay``
    A :class:`~vendorfake.conformance.client.ConformanceClient` wrapping
    another. This is the transport seam: it models a binding that re-encodes,
    truncates or answers for itself. A check cannot tell a wrapped client from
    an unwrapped one, which is exactly the property C10 and C15 exist to test.

Plus four collaborator substitutions that ride in through constructor
parameters the kernel already exposes: :class:`LeakyFaultSelector` (through
``Unit(fault_selector=...)``), :class:`UngatedWebhookDispatcher` and
:class:`ImpatientWebhookDispatcher` (through ``Unit(dispatcher=...)``),
:class:`AuthAdapterOverlay` (through ``VendorOverlay(auth=...)``) and
:class:`PermissiveStateMachine` (through a replaced probe route, which is where
the control plane constructs one).

The two dispatcher subclasses were added with the contracts that catch them.
Both defects -- a delivery gate that consults no capability, and a retry that
is submitted instead of scheduled -- lived in the core with no seam to reach
them, which is why they could be deleted outright and leave the suite green.
