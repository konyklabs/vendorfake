"""A ConformanceTarget for the vendor shipped in this distribution.

Deliberately on the test side of the tree and not inside the package. The
conformance suite must never import a web framework, and the ``http``
transport needs a real server; keeping the factory here is what lets the same
target offer both bindings without any module under ``src/vendorfake/`` doing
something the boundary checker would have to be widened for.

Every client is a freshly constructed unit with an in-memory sink: the suite
builds two units to assert determinism, and a delivery sink that opened real
connections to ``*.test`` hostnames would make the webhook contracts a test of
DNS.

THREE WAYS TO REACH A UNIT, and the third is not a binding
----------------------------------------------------------
``inprocess`` and ``http`` are the two *bindings* the matrix runs, and both
build the unit in this interpreter -- ``http`` is uvicorn on a background
thread. ``subprocess`` is not a third binding but a third *process*: it is
declared in ``ConformanceTarget.out_of_process`` and never in ``transports``,
so nothing runs the whole matrix over it, and the one contract whose claim is
about separate runs opens it deliberately. Conflating the two is what let a
determinism contract compare two units that shared a pid and report
determinism.
