"""The suite, tested the way any other predicate is tested: from both sides.

FOR: turning "the conformance suite defines correctness" from a claim into a
measurement. A suite that has only ever been run against a correct unit has
shown that it terminates. These tests show that it discriminates: every
contract in ``conformance/manifest.json`` is answered by at least one unit that
violates it, and each of those units turns the named check red and leaves the
rest alone.

FIVE PROPERTIES, and each of them has caught something real:

1. **The control is green.** ``M00`` mutates nothing. Without it, a red check
   under some other mutant would carry an unexamined second explanation --
   that the mutant harness builds units differently from ``create_unit``.
2. **Every mutant trips what it names.** A check nobody has ever seen fail is
   a check nobody has shown to work.
3. **No mutant trips what it does not name, and no mutant silences a check.**
   A mutant that reddened everything would prove nothing about the contract it
   targets, and a mutant that turned a contract *off* would look like a pass.
   Both are failures here.
4. **Every registered check has a mutant.** This is the one that bites later:
   it fails the moment a twenty-third contract is added with no evidence it can
   fail, which is exactly when nobody is looking.
5. **A unit that will not start ERRORS, and does not "fail" anything.** The
   mutant that removes a core-gated capability declaration cannot be
   constructed at all. Every contract must report ERROR and none may report
   FAIL, because a report that says ``[FAIL] C11`` about a unit that never ran
   is a report that says nothing about C11.
