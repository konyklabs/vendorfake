"""A real uvicorn on a real socket, driven from a process that knows nothing.

Nothing in this module imports ``vendorfake``. The only thing it shares with
the code under test is HTTP, which is what makes it evidence rather than a
second reading of the same helpers: a bug in a shared serialiser cannot make
both sides agree, because one side is a subprocess and the other is httpx.

The three properties this proves, and cannot be proved anywhere else:

* the form-encoded body arrives intact **over a socket** -- constraint 2's
  "the exact shape that broke two of three implementations" includes the
  socket, and an in-process test never touches uvicorn's h11 parser;
* HTTP and in-process answers are byte-identical, with the difference having
  survived a process boundary in each direction.
