"""Journal-derived delivery, end to end, on a virtual clock.

Every test here runs on the virtual clock and the in-memory sink, so nothing
sleeps and nothing is timing-dependent: a retry cascade that would take
twenty-four hours in production collapses into one ``drain()``.

WHAT IS BEING PINNED, and why each is a decision rather than a detail:

* **commit-then-emit** -- an event exists only because a mutation committed, so
  a handler cannot forget to emit one and cannot emit one for a mutation that
  rolled back;
* **the seed rule** -- loading a scenario containing an open order must not push
  ``order.created`` to every subscriber, and the test that a *non-boolean*
  ``seed`` key still emits is what stops the rule from being "any metadata
  called seed";
* **the synchronous prologue** -- what is true when ``handle()`` returns, stated
  as the weaker claim that is actually true;
* **retry timing and exhaustion** -- twelve attempts, eleven of them failures,
  every time and not merely usually;
* **the four delivery chaos faults** and the exact delivery *order* each
  produces, which is the property a second delivery thread would break;
* **determinism** -- two runs of one scenario produce the same event ids;
* **the de-vendoring** -- with a silent signer the core sends no header at all.

    Review found an AB-BA deadlock introduced by the fix for the broadcast

    ``_request_lock`` -- the journal path is store->request. ``enqueue_to`` is
    the first delivery entry point called straight from a route handler,
    holding neither, and resolving the subscription inside ``_request_lock``
    made it request->store. Neither acquire has a timeout, so the cycle hangs
    the unit permanently.

    A first attempt at this test drove both orders from two threads for forty
    iterations and passed against the deadlocking code, because the window
    between acquiring ``_request_lock`` and reading the store is a few
    instructions wide. A test that cannot fail is worse than no test, so this
