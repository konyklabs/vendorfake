"""Strict mode: a request no route matched, on every vendor and every binding.

The behaviour this pins is a *change* from v0.1, so it is tested from the
consumer's side rather than the kernel's: what a mis-spelled path does in
process, what it does when the consumer has asked for the vendor's own 404
instead, and what it does over a socket -- where raising is not an option and
the diagnosis has to travel as a header.

The auth path is the probe on every vendor because it is the one route every
profile has, needs no credential, and is the first thing a consumer types.
