"""The typed-seed contract: one neutral view, one protocol, and no ``None``.

Three claims are under test here, and only the first two are ordinary runtime
assertions:

1. every seed satisfies :class:`~vendorfake.testing.Seed` structurally, so a
   function typed against the protocol takes all three without an
   ``isinstance``;
2. ``credentials`` reports each vendor's own application credential under the
   neutral names, and the ``grant`` each vendor documents;
3. the narrowing is *load-bearing*: asserted statically in
   ``tests/typing/narrowing.py`` under ``mypy --strict``, negatives included.

The overlay types have a third guard that is an ordinary assertion: their keys
are typed by hand while the seed documents are data, so
``test_every_overlay_type_names_exactly_its_vendors_seed_collections``
compares the two and fails the day a collection is added to a document and not
to its type.

The seedless-vendor test is the other half of "seed is never ``None``". There
is no shipped vendor without a seed -- all three have one -- so the case is
constructed: a vendor definition with a temporary profile directory,
substituted for the registry's lookup for the duration of one call.
