"""The public surface, pinned.

FOR: making a change to what vendorfake promises into an edit a reviewer sees.
``docs/api-contract.md`` says in prose which modules are public and what the
deprecation policy covers; this module is the same statement in a form that
fails a build. Adding a name to a public ``__all__`` -- or removing one, which
is the case that matters -- breaks :func:`test_the_public_surface_is_what_the_contract_says`
until the list below is edited in the same commit, and that edit is the review
trigger. A symbol that reaches a consumer because somebody added an import is
exactly the surface nobody can ever change.

The three assertions here are deliberately about *shape*, not behaviour. What
each public function does is asserted everywhere else in this suite; what is
asserted here is that it is still called what it was called, that it explains
itself, and that it did not drag an internal module out with it.

WHY ``__all__`` AND NOT ``dir()``. ``dir()`` reports imports, re-exports and
every name a module happened to bind, which would make this test fail on a
refactor that changed nothing a consumer can see -- noise, and noise gets
silenced. ``__all__`` is a deliberate statement, so pinning it pins the
deliberate part.
