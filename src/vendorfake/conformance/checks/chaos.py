"""C08, C12, C14, C27 -- fault injection is deterministic, leak-proof, gated, and counts honestly.

Three contracts about one subsystem, and each of them names a defect that has
actually shipped.

C08: the same rules and the same traffic must produce the same failures. A
fault engine that draws from a system random is a flake generator, and a
consumer cannot write "the second create fails" as a test against it.

C12: a per-request trigger must not touch standing state. The trap is not the
configuration -- which is easy to keep clean -- but the *counters*: a one-shot
that advances a standing rule's occurrence count turns "the second create
fails" into "the first", silently, and only for consumers who also use the
in-band trigger.

C14: a capability is only real if every entry point passes the same gate. The
losing bake-off entry read a per-request chaos header before any capability
check, so a unit with fault injection switched off still injected faults for
anyone who knew the header name.
