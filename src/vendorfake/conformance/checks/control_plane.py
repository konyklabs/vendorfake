"""C01, C30-C33 -- the unit describes itself, describing is free, and it says so when nothing answered.

Every other contract reads the control plane to aim itself, so C01 runs first and states the minimum: the unit is alive, says what it is, and publishes its own surface.

C30 through C32 assert that looking at the fake must not change what it says next (konyklabs/roadmap#42, konyklabs/vendorfake#31). C33 is the other direction: what the unit says about a request it could not answer, since a vendor's own 404 cannot name anything -- the diagnosis rides in a header and the request is recorded as unmatched.
