"""C04, C05 -- no consumer ever meets anything but the vendor's own error.

C04 asserts it at the edge: the paths a web framework likes to answer for
itself -- an unknown URL, a wrong verb, a body that will not parse -- all come
back shaped by the vendor. C05 asserts it in the middle: every failure kind
the core can raise has a mapping, so no future code path can produce a shape
nobody chose.

Together they are the reason a consumer can write one error handler. A fake
that answers a framework's 404 for an unknown path, or a validation library's
422 for a malformed body, teaches a consumer's code to expect documents the
real vendor never sends.
