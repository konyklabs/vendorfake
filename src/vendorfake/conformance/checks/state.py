"""C06, C07, C13, C19, C20, C22, C24, C25, C26, C36 -- state is reproducible, append-only, honestly gated, deduplicated per operation, paged without overlap, and seeded from a document an overlay may narrow but not invent keys in.

C06 is the property a consumer's CI depends on: two units built the same way hold the same entities, so a test that passed this morning does not fail this afternoon because an id was drawn from a system random. C07 is what makes the journal usable as an event source rather than as decoration. C13 is the lifecycle: a state machine that quietly permits a self-transition turns "pay this order twice" into a success.

    This is a CLASS check, for the same reason C17 is: every example-bearing idempotent route spends a key, every declared scope is then probed against every spent key it must not see, and every route sharing a spent key's scope is probed for the visibility the shared declaration promises. Declaration rules run first, because behaviour probes over incoherent declarations prove nothing:

    * **Not all one string.** N operations declaring a single scope have removed the namespace the field exists for.
    * **A shared scope stays inside one capability.** A namespace spanning capabilities is half-disabled whenever one capability is switched off; an alias pair -- the legitimate share -- lives where its operation lives.
    * **A shared scope declares one on_mismatch.** Two routes sharing a namespace but promising different mismatch answers is a promise that depends on which alias the retry happens to hit.
    * **A shared scope has a drivable member.** A share none of whose routes publishes an example is a share nothing can verify.

    A partner answer of ``idempotency_conflict`` is AFFIRMATIVE evidence the key was found in that scope (the mismatch branch only runs on a stored record); a partner answer otherwise counts as "the route answered for itself" only when it proves the request got past the key lookup -- a 2xx, or a kind in :data:`_PROOF_THE_LOOKUP_MISSED`. The journal is read around every probe: neither a post-lookup refusal nor a shared-scope declared-direction answer may append an entry. The positive direction, "a fresh success journals", is deliberately not asserted, since a no-op 2xx is real vendor behaviour (Square's batch-create under ``ignore_unchanged_counts`` commits nothing). Keys are spent first and probed after, since one route (UpdateOrder) pins its example to the seed's entity version and can succeed only once per unit.

    The journal brackets are race-free by construction: the seq only moves in ``Store.append_journal``, called solely from Collection mutations under the store lock, and this check drives one probe at a time on serialized routes.

    An overlay is the only input to a unit that has nothing to be wrong against: a whole seed document is validated by the vendor's hydration, but a partial document naming ``order`` for a vendor whose collection is ``orders`` merges cleanly, hydrates nothing, and presents an hour later as "the fake ignored my scenario" with no message anywhere. So the refusal is a contract, asserted while the unit is built.

    Four claims. The refusal comes second rather than last, since the positive control is built from what the refusal's own message reports -- the collections this vendor's seed carries, the only vendor-independent way for a clause here to name one.

    The positive control must be non-empty and observable: ``active`` and a digest are computed from the document the unit was handed, not from anything it did with it, so an implementation that reported both faithfully and then dropped the overlay on the floor would otherwise pass. The overlay empties a collection the profile actually seeds and the check reads ``GET /__unit/state`` back: the count has to move, or a merge that no-ops fails. The collection is chosen from whatever the refusal's own listing and this profile's entity counts agree exists, and emptied with ``[]`` rather than an added entity, since no vendor-independent clause knows what one of its entities looks like.

    The refusal message is parsed for its ``Valid collections:`` listing rather than merely searched for the offending key, since "names the vendor's valid collections" is half the clause. The phrase is part of the contract; ``core/config/overlay.py`` writes it.
