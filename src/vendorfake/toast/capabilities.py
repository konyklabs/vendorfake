"""What this vendor can be asked to do, and what it deliberately does not model.

Declares the capability set once so the route table, the control plane's
capability index and the core's gating all read the same list, and records,
with reasons, every documented Toast behaviour this fake omits.

INVARIANT: every capability the core gates on is accounted for -- the core
fails at construction when a gated capability (``chaos``, ``webhooks``,
``webhooks.chaos``) is neither declared here nor excused in
``VendorDefinition.not_supported`` with a reason.

``webhooks``/``webhooks.chaos`` are declared together with the signer, event
mapper and subscription stand-in, so a capability is never declared while
the dispatcher would silently no-op on a missing seam.

``not_supported`` may not name anything the core does not gate on, so the
documented Toast features this fake omits live in :data:`TOAST_NOT_MODELED`,
which the surfaces cite in refusals.
