"""Every identifier the shipped seed scenario contains, as importable names,
so tests and a consumer's own fixtures have one place to learn the scenario.

INVARIANT: these constants and ``default.seed.json`` agree; a test asserts
every name below against the document as shipped.

Guids are lowercase UUIDs (``ids.py``), readable-on-purpose fakes with a
``...-4000-8000-...`` middle so they also pass a v4 shape check.
``multiLocationId`` values are 18-digit numeric strings like the documented
``100000000171239701``. JUDGMENT: the seeded tokens are readable strings
rather than JWTs, since a human types them into curl commands; every token
the login route mints is JWT-shaped.
