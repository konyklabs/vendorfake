"""The unit contract: everything a vendor module implements against.

INVARIANT: **this is deliberately not an HTTP contract.** A unit consumes a ``UnitRequest`` and produces a
``UnitResponse``; ``transport`` names whichever binding produced it. ``raw_body`` is the exact received bytes and
``body`` is already serialised, because a webhook signature covers raw bytes. Path templates are ``{order_id}``,
never ``:order_id``, in all four places one is consumed: the router, the chaos ``match.route`` key, the
capability-to-routes index and the generated OpenAPI document.

INVARIANT: **the core is synchronous** -- ``Handler`` returns a value, not an awaitable, because await points would
interleave concurrent requests and make id minting non-deterministic.
