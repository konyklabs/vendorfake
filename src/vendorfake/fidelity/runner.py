"""Running the corpus: one fresh unit per case, every step in order, first failure wins.

FOR: being the framework-free façade over the corpus, exactly as
``conformance/runner.py`` is over the registry. The CLI and the pytest plugin
both come here; neither adds an assertion the other lacks.

INVARIANT: **each case gets its own freshly built unit.** A case's steps share
one unit -- that is what makes a two-step order-then-pay flow expressible --
but two cases never do, so case order is never load-bearing and a case that
mutates state cannot poison the next one. The target owns construction and
teardown through ``open_unit``; this module only asks.

SECOND INVARIANT: **the client is injectable, and the default one validates.**
``run_corpus`` builds a ``ValidatingClient`` over the target's declaration
and extract unless told otherwise, so the behaviour leg runs the contract
leg for free on every response it reads. ``validate=False`` -- and every
``--base-url`` run, where there is no unit object to validate through -- is
recorded in the report as such, never silently.

WHY THE TARGET IS NAMED AND NEVER GUESSED: the same layer rule as the
conformance package. This module may not import a vendor or the registry, so
``resolve_target("module:attr")`` is how a vendor is reached.
