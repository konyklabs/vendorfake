"""The fetch-never-commit path: a non-vendored vendor's extract, cut at run time.

FOR: konyklabs/roadmap#56. A vendor whose terms do not permit a copy of its
specification in a public repository declares ``vendored: false``; its
``pin.json`` still ships (sha256, size, version, fetch date of each upstream
file -- facts, not copies -- plus the modeled route list the cut was scoped
to) and its extract is cut here from a fresh fetch into a local cache
directory that is never inside the repository.

INVARIANT: **no upstream byte is written under the package.** The cache lives
under ``$VENDORFAKE_FIDELITY_CACHE``, else ``$XDG_CACHE_HOME/vendorfake/fidelity``,
else ``~/.cache/vendorfake/fidelity``, keyed by the anchor and the pin: the
cached ``extract.json`` is used only while its sha256 is the pin's
``extract_sha256``, and anything else is re-fetched and re-cut.

SECOND INVARIANT: **a vendor release never fails a test run.** When a fetched
document no longer matches its pinned row, the extract is still cut from the
fresh bytes and cached; the discrepancy is written to ``DRIFT`` beside it and
one ``UPSTREAM MOVED`` line goes to stderr. ``pin --check`` is what fails on
drift, on purpose, in the one place a failure is actionable.
