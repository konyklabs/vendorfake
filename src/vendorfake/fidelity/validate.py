"""Every response a unit gives, checked against the vendor's schema for it, so the vendor's own test suite enforces "the fake answers what the vendor documents" for free: wrapping the in-process client once turns each existing call into a schema check, and a body that drifts from the published shape fails the test that produced it, naming the JSON pointer that is wrong.

The wrapper observes; it never interprets. ``call()`` returns the very :class:`InProcessResponse` the plain client would have returned, and the only way it can change a test is by raising -- read after the unit has answered, so nothing here can affect what the unit does.

Three things are deliberately not validated, and each is counted rather than dropped: a route the declaration excuses, a control-plane route, and a request nothing routed. A route that is none of those and not in the extract is undeclared, and undeclared raises.

The classification itself lives in :class:`ResponseValidator`, which reads a ``UnitRequest`` and the ``UnitResponse`` the unit gave for it and nothing else, so the same check runs behind the in-process client (:class:`ValidatingClient`) and behind a socket (``vendorfake serve --validate`` hands it to the ASGI binding as a ``ResponseObserver``).

Validation is ``openapi_schema_validator``'s OAS 3.0 dialect with a ``referencing`` registry that holds the extract document under one URI, so every ``#/components/schemas/...`` reference resolves against the extract and nothing else. Validators are built once per operation and status and reused for the life of the validator. Request bodies use the same machinery through the ``Write`` reader of that dialect, which is what OAS 3.0 means by a body being sent rather than received.
