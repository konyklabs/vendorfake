# One image, every installed vendor. Which one it serves is decided at run
# time by VENDORFAKE_VENDOR (or `serve --vendor <name>` as the command), never
# at build time: nothing below names a vendor, and tools/verify_image_build.sh
# fails if that ever changes. Adding a vendor is adding a package under
# src/vendorfake/ -- this file does not change.
#
# The build stage produces a WHEEL and installs that, rather than copying the
# source tree into the runtime. A data file that hatch does not package -- a
# profile, a seed document -- is then missing from the image the same way it
# would be missing from `pip install`, and the healthcheck says so, instead
# of the container working from a source tree that pip never ships.
